### Personal Information

- **Name: Di-Anne Wyngaard**
- **Date: 16 March 2025**
- **Current Role/Position: Full-time student**
- **Field of Interest: Software Development**

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - <u>Current skills and areas of expertise:</u> 
    1. Git and GitHub: Cloning, downloading, and forking a repository, managing changes with Git using Git commands. 
    2.HTML5: built a basic Catportfolio HTML document using HTML5 boilerplate, structural tags, link tags, text formatting tags, and self-closing tags with their attributes. 
    3.CSS: CSS basics which includes selectors, properties, values and linking CSS to HTML document. CSS pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, attribute selectors, CSS animations, layout with CSS using Flexbox and Grid. Awarded a certificate of completion on Scrimba for their Flexbox course.
    - <u>Skills I need to develop or improve:</u> Applying CSS well is a big challenge, more specifically CSS animations, CSS layout using Flexbox and Grid, media queries and how to create designs that adapt to different screen sizes. I need much more practice with CSS.

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - <u>What interest me?</u> Its too soon to tell what interests me as the field of software development is broad (back-end, front-end, full-stack) and I have recently begun my journey in the Tech industry. But so far, my interest lies in creating simple web pages. I enjoy struggling and solving code for web pages because I can immediately see my creation come to life which is rewarding and encouriging. It is the oposite of monotonous work which I hate. The effort of solving gives me sort of a thrill; its a love-hate relationship. I enjoyed mathematics in high school and I see similarities with software development. But designing web pages with advanced CSS and layouts is quite complex for me and I dont enjoy it because I struggle with it alot and it becomes discouraging. However, I just started learning CSS thus my mind might change at a later stage once I get the hang of it after having practiced it abit more.
    - <u>What values are important to me in a work environment?</u> I was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety which I take medication for. So its very important for me to be in a workspace that is supportive, serene and empowering. It should be a workplace that is committed to employee well-being (mental and physical health). I value an environment that embraces the growth-mindset. 

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - <u>Industries or roles you have researched:</u> Softserve is a company based in Gauteng piqued my interest.
    - <u>Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.</u> They specialize in mobile app development, software application development and building websites and have work big companies like Nike, Discovery, and Total Sports.

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - <u>How do these industries/ roles align with my skills, interests, and values?</U> <i>Softserve</i> piqued my interest because I will have an opportunity to iether go into mobile app development, software application development or building websites which is what I am learning at CodeSpace. After completing the course, I will have skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which is needed to land a Junior Software Development role. I tend to hyperfocus as a result of my ADHD which can be a strength that can be used as a powerful tool for tackling complex problems in the Software Development role thus sometimes I tend to leave a piece of my soul on any work that I do. I am interested in creating web pages as I enjoy seeing my creation come to life in a beautiful layout. <i>Softserve</i> has good values which matches mine. Namely, Meraki which is japanese for leave a piece of your soul. They believe in striving for excellence in every project they do and have good reviews from clients for this value. They also value philotimo (japanese for deep love of community) and I strongly value a workspace that embodies this especially given my mental health. Another value is Kaizen (japanese for continious improvement), I value growth-mindset; there is always room for improvement and mistakes are mere learning opportunities.
    - <u>Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.</u> I would like to explore their work dynamic between employees and employers abit more. As well as Back-end Development to see if its something I might prefer. 

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

    <u>SMART GOAL:</u>
    - Specific: 75% Average for CodeSpace Software Development course because I want to land a Junior Developer role by next year latest.
    - Measurable: Submit all challenges in the week and not the weekend so that I can ask questions in the coaching sessions. Submitting on time will assist with achieving the end goal, keeping track with lesson plan and google calendar. Goal: score 80% and above for challenges and aim for 80% for big projects.
    - Achievable: Currently, I am quite behind with my course work but there is still time to make up for it because we have only submitted 3 challenges and still have many left to do, including big projects which count the most.

    - Time-bound: 75% average by end of course (June). And start applying for jobs this year to land a Junior Developer role at early next year.
